# ArrMan - Assembly course project - 3rd year of CS

This project aims to manipulate positive integer array using Assembly language.<br>
The name is inspired from the purpose (Arr -> array, Man -> Manipulation)  
(<•>_<•>)

#### Operations on array
- Input as much multi digit numbers as you want as elements (e.g 125)
- Get the array Summation
- Get the array Average
- Get the Minium/Maximum values of the array
- Get the Mode of the array (Most occurred value)
- Sort the array (Bubble sort)
- Print the array

#### Operations to be implemented
- Insert items at index
- Remove item at index


## Notes on ArrMan
- ArrMan array is word defined elements, which maximum value of entered element is 65536 (best case)
- Array elements all should add up to 65536, anything higher will cause into implicit overflow, since Operations are done using AX.  

## How to run it
Clone the project, then run the ArrMan.asm using any 8086 assembler, [Emu8086 Assembler](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.softonic-ar.com/download) is preferred since ArrMan is built using it.
